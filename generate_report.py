## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the MSRJD field theory codebase implementation, focusing on:
1. **Physics Implementation Correctness**: Assessment of propagator and vertex extraction physics
2. **Function Usage Mapping**: Complete inventory of all functions and their usage patterns  
3. **Code Cleanup Opportunities**: Identification of unused, duplicate, and obsolete code
4. **Architectural Recommendations**: Suggestions for code simplification and maintenance
